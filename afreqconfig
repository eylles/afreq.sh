# sample config for the afreq daemon

# the thresholds are the MINIMUM cpu usage percentage at which the setting for governor or boost
# will be applied, these values are ONLY INTEGERS WITHOUT the percentage sign.

# the minimum threshold to activate the performance governor cannot be lower than 5% cpu usage
# the minimum threshold to activate the schedutil governor cannot be lower or equal than the minimum
# for the performance governor, it also cannot be more than 95% cpu usage.

# similarely the turbo boost is capped at 5% minimum and 95% maximum for the threshold value.
